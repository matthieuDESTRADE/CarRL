### RL PROJECT

This project aims to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to create an autonomous agent able to play to a simple racing game.

The file `game.py` contains the code to run the game. 

The file `DQN_main.ipynb` contains the code to train DQN agents and test all agents. The environment is contained in the file `enviroment.py`. The networks are contained in the file `policy.py`. The functions required for training are contained in the file `deep_Q_newtork.py`.

The file `evolutionary_algos.ipynb` contains the code to train evolutionary agents.
